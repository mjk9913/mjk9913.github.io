            I'm a rising Junior at <b>New York University Abu Dhabi</b> studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. <br />
            I am studying at the New York Campus for Fall 2022. <br /> <br />

            Prior to moving to Abu Dhabi, I grew up in <b>Korea</b> and <b>Indonesia</b>, where I was fortunate enough to grow up in culturally diverse communities
            and see how technology evolves and affects different parts of the world. <br /> <br />

            Outside of my classes, you'll find me involved with: <br />
            👩‍⚖️ Student Government Athletics Committee <br />
            🥅 Women's Football + Touch Rugby Club Team <br />
            🧩 Working at the Dean of Students office + Moses Center <br /> <br />
